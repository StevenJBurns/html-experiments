    <div>At the United Nations, the Security Council condemned the attacks as "heinous and cowardly acts," and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke to Putin by telephone, offering his condolences and stressing the importance of international cooperation to fight terrorism, according to the U.N. press office.  Russian authorities ordered police to increase security at train stations and other transportation facilities across the country. The heightened security comes as Russians are preparing to celebrate the New Year, the nation's main holiday.  In St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, the local governor canceled a New Year's fireworks show.  Vladimir Markin, the spokesman for Russia's main investigative agency, the Investigative Committee, said Monday's explosion involved a bomb similar to the one used Sunday, indicating that the two attacks were linked. Markin said a suicide attacker was responsible for Monday's bus explosion that killed at least 14 people. It was not clear if authorities counted the bomber in their death toll.  In October, a suicide bombing on a bus in Volgograd killed six people.</div>
